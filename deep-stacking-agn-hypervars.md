title: Deep Stacking of AGN Hypervariables

When matter falls into supermassive black holes with angular momentum, it accretes in a superheated, luminous disk on the surface of the event horizon. Modern accretion disk theory predicts that these disks should be extremely stable, and their luminosity should not vary on short timescales, but experimental data dramatically contradicts this.

In 2020, I wrote my undergraduate thesis on one such hypervariable active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J094511. Using data from the Liverpool Telescope on Las Palmas, I stacked many short exposures of this object and experimented with various resampling techniques to extract luminosity profiles of the object. These profiles demonstrate the presence of an intervening galaxy, which may be responsible for a gravitational lensing event.
