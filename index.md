Alex Wheaton is studying astrophysics at The University of Edinburgh. This is
his personal blog, which hosts all his creative and scientific work. He is
chiefly concerned with astronomy and linguistics, but this site also hosts
ceramic artwork, cartographic illustrations, short fiction, crossword puzzles,
and other miscellany.
